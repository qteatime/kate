Kate v0.23.8  (August 2023)
=======================================================================

The v0.23.8 is August's experimental release of Kate. This is a
breaking release.

!!BREAKING CHANGE!!
New cartridge format
--------------------

0.23.8 uses a new block-based cartridge format and will not be able
to read previous cartridge versions. This means that this version
will not be able to upgrade past cartridges or load past cartridges.

The new cartridge version is simpler and lays the necessary groundwork
for supporting signed cartridges and better memory usage — the current
implementation still reads the entire cartridge in memory, but future
implementations will stream the contents instead.

Cache refreshing support
------------------------

In order to work offline in the browser, Kate caches all of the files
needed to run the application locally. Sometimes this cache might get
out of sync with updates and use; this version adds a new "Refresh cache"
operation to the `Diagonstics & Recovery` section to help with such
issues.

Support for navigation requests
-------------------------------

Kate blocks all network access in cartridges for security and privacy,
but there are cases where it is reasonable to allow a cartridge to
open an URL in the user's browser (e.g.: if it's linking to the
developers' pages in a credits screen).

This version introduces a new capability to support this feature and
the necessary rails to allow this to work with the user's active
consent (and some minimal auditing support).

PRs: #15


Proper capability support
-------------------------

Since this version introduces the first capabilities in the console, it
also introduces a way for users to manage capabilities at any time. The
new permissions screen allows users to revoke capabilities even while
cartridges are running (and it takes effect immediately), to mitigate
the damage if a cartridge abuses its powers.

PRs: #16


Audit logs!
-----------

This version introduces proper audit logs with a retention and cleanup
policy. This gives users a more persistent view of what their console
has been up to in the background. There's no automated audit based on
this yet, but that may be coming in future versions as well.

PRs: #18


Minor changes
-------------

  * The default keyboard key for Kate's `Capture` button is now `C` instead
    of `Left Control`. The change is due to how browsers' shortcuts depend
    on Control modifiers, making captures be triggered when the user did not
    intend them to be.

  * Cartridge boxes in the library now show the stability of the cartridge
    (e.g.: if it's a demo, a beta release, or a regular one), as well as the
    age rating. (PRs: #17)

  * Older, unused and undocumented API experiments have been removed from the
    source code. This doesn't impact any cartridge, but it reduces the Kerne's
    attack surface and moves us further towards a proper secure Kate release.

  * There's a new developer-oriented settings screen with the only option
    being relaxing Kate's installation preconditions so you can reinstall
    the same version of the cartridge — good for iterating while dev'ing.

  * Cartridges that do not have a thumbnail image now have their title shown
    in the cartridge box instead, which makes it easier to figure out what
    all the black boxes are if devs haven't included a cover image.


Fixed bugs
----------

  * Fixed an issue where the last cartridge would not scroll fully into
    view upon selection if there were many cartridges before it in the
    library.

  * Changed how IndexedDB indexes are used in Kate so that we don't trigger
    the semantic issues Safari has with it. This makes Kate partially supported
    in iOS again — but do note that Safari still lacks implementation for many
    of the APIs Kate relies on, such as webp recording for screen recording.
