   Fantasy console
      A gaming console that could exist, but for which there's no hardware
      you can just walk into a store and buy. Though you could build the
      console yourself from the technical specification, games are generally
      played on an :term:`emulator`` for the console.
   
   Emulator
      An application that can run applications made for different devices,
      by tricking the application into thinking it's running in the device
      it was made for. Kate's emulator allows playing games made for Kate's
      hardware on a web browser, Windows, Linux, MacOS, Raspberry Pi,
      SteamDeck, and more.

   Requirement rank
      A one-letter code, from **C** to **A**, which tells you how powerful
      your device's hardware should be in order to run a particular Kate
      cartridge smoothly.
