Web game support
================

Because Kate runs on top of a web browser, porting web games to Kate
cartridges is feasible, but may require some effort. Kate itself is
not a browser platform, so some games that can run on a browser might
still be a poor fit for Kate.

This section goes through porting of web games in general. See
the :ref:`Kate Porting Recipes book` for special support for common
engines that have a web export option.
