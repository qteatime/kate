Kate API
========

The Kate API provides a way for a cartridge to interact with the
Kate Kernel in order to do more than just rendering things on the
screen. All APIs that Kate provides are accessible from the cartridge using
the global ``KateAPI`` object.

This section includes a reference of all APIs provided
by Kate.
