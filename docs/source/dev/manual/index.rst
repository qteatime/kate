Making games for Kate!
======================

.. warning::

   Kate is still in development, and this book is a work in progress.

Kate is a small :term:`fantasy console <fantasy console>` for small
2d games, particularly story-rich ones. It's built to be privacy and
security-conscious, and to empower players and developers. Anyone can
build and distribute games for Kate free of charge, with no special
devices required.

The Kate :term:`emulator` runs on any device with a modern web-browser,
providing :term:`virtual buttons <virtual button>` for touch-based devices so everyone
experiences your game the same way. When programming for Kate you
write your game for a single platform, distribute it as a single file,
and players can run the game in any device with a modern web browser.

This manual describes the basics of developing for Kate, as well as
providing details on its approach to security and privacy.
