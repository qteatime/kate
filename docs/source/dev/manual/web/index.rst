Web game support
================

Because Kate runs on top of a web browser, porting web games to Kate
cartridges is feasible. Just note that Kate itself is not a browser platform,
so ports will still take some effort, and some games that can run on a browser
might still be a poor fit for Kate.

This section goes through porting of web games in general. See
the :doc:`Kate Porting Recipes book </dev/port/index>` for special support for common
engines that have a web export option.
