Kate Porting Recipes
====================

Kate aims to provide out-of-box support for games made with common engines.
We call this support a "Porting Recipe"â€”built-in programs that will take
care of the porting for you with minimal configuration on your side.

Before you dive into the specifics of porting for your engine of choice,
be sure to read up on how packaging cartridges for Kate works in general.
The :doc:`developer setup guide </dev/manual/intro/setup>` and the
:doc:`creating your first cartridge tutorial </dev/manual/intro/hello-world>`
will get you started on the basic concepts. It's also a good idea to
understand the :doc:`basics of Kate's Bridges </dev/manual/web/index>`, as
they're the main concept porting recipes use.

Porting recipes are currently available for the following engines:
