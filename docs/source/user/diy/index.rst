=======================
Build Your Own Console!
=======================

.. warning::

  Kate is still in development, and this book is a work in progress. Many of
  the necessary features for building a proper physical console are not yet
  provided.


Kate is a DIY video game console primarily designed for small indie and
story-rich games (particularly Visual Novels/Interactive Fiction, Adventures,
and RPGs). There's no official store where you can buy a ready-to-use
physical Kate console, or games for Kate, however you can build your own
console and games with readily available components and some electronics
and software tinkering.

This book will cover all the necessary steps needed to build your own
console, from the hardware, to the physical casing, to the operating
system and applications/game cartridges. For each of these steps you
also have the choice of just picking off-the-shelf components without
customising them.
