The Kate User Manual
====================

.. warning::
   
   Kate is still in development, and this book is a work in progress.


Kate is a :term:`fantasy console <fantasy console>` for small
2d games, particularly story-rich ones. Being a fantasy console, you'll
likely be running these games in the Kate :term:`emulator`, rather than
an actual Kate device. The emulator runs directly on your browser, but
you can also run it as a native application on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

The primary goal for Kate is to build a gaming device that respects
and empowers you, the player. It's built to be security and
privacy-conscious, as well as to not limit how you choose to play
your games. We want to make sure you have a fun (and safe!) time,
regardless of what cartridge you choose to run.

To get started you should :doc:`get the Kate emulator <intro/install>`. You
may then :doc:`find out more about Kate's features <gaming/index>` and
:doc:`its approach to security and privacy <security/index>`.
