Playing games
=============

Games for Kate are packaged in a :doc:`special ROM cartridge file <cartridges>`.
Before you can run them you'll need to :ref:`install the cartridge <installing cartridges>`.

Kate can run web games (provided they don't need internet access to run). 
You'll be able to find and download games pre-packaged for Kate in the
upcoming Kate Store. For now, you can either
`browse Kate ROMs on Itch.io <https://itch.io/games/tag-kate-rom>`_, or
try :doc:`importing a non-Kate game <import>` into the console. The importer
works with `Bitsy <https://bitsy.org/>`_ and `Ren'Py <https://www.renpy.org/>`_
games for now.
