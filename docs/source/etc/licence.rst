============
Terms of use
============

Kate is made possible thanks to the amazing work of other people
shared under permissive licences. The software and assets that
make up Kate are listed here.

Kate's original source code is released under the :ref:`MIT licence`.
This means that there's no charge to using Kate, and it also means
that you can modify and share it without any limit. But you need to
keep the licence terms and attribution with all copies you share.

Likewise, there are no limits imposed on anything you make with
(or from) Kate, granted you abide by the licence terms above.

Kate's original non-code assets, such as the illustration of the
Kate mascot and virtual button icons, are released under the
CC0 1.0 Universal Licence. This means that they're essentially
in the public domain.

Some of the UI sounds are currently generated with jsfxr.

Full text for all relevant licences are included here after
attributions, in the goal of making them offline-friendly.
