# Known Issues & Limitations

Kate is currently released as a preview/early-access software. This means that there are many issues with the technology still that require some ironing out. This page describes the current issues and limitations.

## Platform-specific issues

- Video captures are not supported in Safari on iOS;

- HTML transformations are not applied to elements changing dynamically (this affects e.g.: Twine games);

- In Safari, `Install cartridge...` only works if the player taps the button; this is due to some issues with user activation in Kate's event handling and Safari being more strict there;

- The way Kate OS handles focus makes it hard to navigate to certain overlapping elements with the D-Pad;

- Thumbnails for the media gallery have poor resizing quality;
