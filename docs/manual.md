# The Kate Manual

> **NOTE**: This is a living document. Information here applies to Kate v0.23.4

Kate is a fantasy hand-held console for small 2d applications, particularly RPGs, Visual Novels, and similar story-driven games. As a fantasy console, games are generally run in an emulator programâ€”the current emulator can run as a native application in Windows, Linux, and MacOS, as well as in a modern web browser (supporting Android, iOS, and other devices).

Kate is an accessibility, security, and privacy conscious platform. We want players to be in control of their gaming experience, and we want to make sure they have a fun (and safe!) time playing regardless of what cartridge they choose to run.

This manual describes both the underlying technology for Kate, so you have a better idea of how it achieves this safety and privacy goals, as well as how to develop and share games for it.

| ![](./img/r_24.png)       | R       | S          | Right bumper (frontmost) (5)                                                |
| ![](./img/menu_24.png)    | Menu    | Left Shift | Left special button (8)<br><small>(e.g.: Select on SNES, View on XBox)      |
| ![](./img/capture_24.png) | Capture | Left Ctrl  | Right special button (9)<br><small>(e.g.: Start on SNES, Menu on XBox)      |

Kate also supports controlling the emulator by touching/clicking the virtual buttons in the emulator application. For the bumpers, it's enough to touch anywhere near the top left/right corners of the emulator; you should see the button highlighted or moving on the screen when you do.

You can also use off-the-shelf gamepads with Kate. The button layout matches the one described in the [Gamepad][std-gamepad] specification. Numbers here refer to the buttons described there.

### Context menu

You can bring up the context menu by holding `Menu` for one second. The context menu provides useful commands for the current emulator context, which either be "OS" or "In-Game context".

> **NOTE:**  
> Bringing the context menu while in-game will pause the game. Note that for games not designed especifically for Kate, "pause" mostly means that none of the button input will be forwarded to the game window; the game will continue running normally otherwise.

In the "OS" context you can:

- **Power off**: closes the emulator (only available in the **Native** mode);
- **Fullscreen**: puts the emulator in or out of full-screen mode. Mostly useful in mobile phones where the screen is partly taken by address bars and such;
- **Install cartridge**: installs a cartridge from a `.kart` file (see [Kate Cartridges](#kate-cartridges) for details);

In the "Game" context you can:

- **Close game**: closes the game and returns to the OS context;
- **Fullscreen**: puts the emulator in or out of fullscreen. Note that you can't put just the game in full-screen for now;
- **Legal notices**: opens the licenses and other important legal information for the current game;
- **Media gallery**: opens the media gallery filtered by screenshots and videos for the current game;

### Screenshots and captures

You can take a screenshot of a game that has opted to support it by pressing the `Capture` button once. You can start recording a video by holding the `Capture` button for one second. Hold it again for another second to stop recording and save the video.

Both screenshots and videos are stored in the emulator, counting towards the cartridge's storage usage. Through the Media Gallery application you can view them, delete them, and download to your device's files from there.

> **NOTE:**  
> Kate is not always recording, so holding the capture button to save the last N seconds as a video, which is common in other consoles, does not currently work. This is a feature that will be added to the emulator in the future.
>
> Audio is, likewise, not currently recorded with the video, but will be in a future version.

## Kate modes

The Kate emulator is distributed in multiple forms (called "modes"), and they have slightly different capabilities:

- **Native Application**: the [Electron][] based emulator you can install as a native app on Windows, Linux, and MacOS;
- **Web Application**: the online emulator you can run by accessing https://kate.qteati.me
- **Single Application**: a special version of the emulator packaged with a single game for developers to publish on a platform like Itch.io.

The **Web Application** mode has limited functionality and may require you to touch or click the emulator at least once before gamepad support, audio, and other features are enabled.

The **Single Application** mode cannot install games, it's designed to run a single cartridge that is bundled with it. As a player, this is not a mode you download to play other games, but it's one you may come across online outside of https://kate.qteati.me.

You can always check which mode the emulator is running by going to `Applications -> About Kate` and checking the `System` section.

Note that due to security limitations, the `Host` and `Hardware` sections are not accurate in the **Web** and **Single** modes.

## Kate Cartridges

Games for Kate are packaged in a special binary format called a Kate Cartridge (with the `.kart` extension). Cartridges contain the complete data for a video game or application that runs in Kate. You can think of it like a ROM in other common emulators.

You install games by dragging cartridge files from your computer and dropping them on top of the Kate emulator. In devices where dragging files is not easily achievable, like in mobile phones, you can install cartridges by holding down `Menu` for one second, and then selecting `Install cartridge`. This will open up a file picker where you can choose the `.kart` file to install.

Kate limits cartridges to a maximum size of 512MB. This is close to what you would get if the game was packaged as a CD in the 2000s. It's a reasonable choice given Kate's hardware limitations, but also helps users have more space to install games. Sharing (space) is caring!

Once installed you can run the game at any time without needing to keep the `.kart` file around. However, it's good to keep your `.kart` files in some backup storage (such as a CD, an external hard disk, or in cloud storage) so that you can delete games that you're not actively playing anymore to make up space on your device, and later come back to them by re-installing from the same cartridge file.

### What's sandboxing?

Kate cartridges are sandboxed for security. This means that, by default, cartridges in Kate can do five things:

- Read files that were packaged with the cartridge (but only those files!);
- Play sounds through your device's audio output;
- Display things on the small 800x480 piece of screen made available to them by the emulator;
- React to your input, provided to the cartridge in terms of Kate buttons pressed or released;
- And store very small amounts of data, of up to 32MB, used for save files.

For anything else, the game will need to ask you for permission, and you may choose to allow them to do it (if you trust the cartridge enough), or not. This is not much different from how your phone requires applications to ask for permission to use the camera or microphone, Kate just takes it a bit further to protect privacy as well.

Unlike phones, note that Kate does not allow cartridges to make any online connections by default. This is both for privacy (e.g.: a cartridge would not be able to profile your device to track you elsewhere), and for security (e.g.: many malicious applications steal sensitive information and need to send it somewhere on the internet).

By doing this Kate makes it possible for you to download a `.kart` file from anywhere, install it in a Kate emulator, and play the game without being as careful with it as you would have to downloading a native executable. If the cartridge turns out to be malicious in the end, as long you don't give it more permissions than the default ones there isn't much damage it can do.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:**  
> In the **Single Application** mode there are no security or privacy guarantees that Kate can make. That's because whoever is distributing the Kate emulator to you controls those guarantees instead, you'd have to trust that they're upholding all of the guarantees above first.
