# Boon-scrolling

This is a remake of [a silly little April's Fools game](https://github.com/qteatime/boon-scrolling) I made in 2021. This version uses Kate's input, has a prettier UI, and has a couple of sound effects, which highlight some simple uses of Kate's APIs.

## Building

Run `node make example:boon-scrolling` or `node make example:all` at the root of this repository to compile this project. A `boon-scrolling.kart` cartridge should be created in this folder, which you can then install in Kate.
