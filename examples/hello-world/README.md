# Hello, from Kate

A simple hello-world type of demo that lets you check if your Kate build is working correctly by showing which keys you're pressing on-screen.

## Building

Run `node make example:hello-world` or `node make example:all` at the root of this repository to compile this project. A `hello.kart` cartridge should be created in this folder, which you can then install in Kate.
