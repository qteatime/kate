This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

Linking the Kate operating system or any of its components statically
or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on
the Kate operating system. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

Kate programs are generally distributed in the form of cartridge files that
are linked dynamically to the Kate operating system to function.
As a special exception, the copyright holders of the Kate operating system
give you permission to combine the Kate operating system with any cartridge
that communicates with the Kate operating system solely through the
Kate Runtime API. This combination does not by itself cause the resulting
cartridge to be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception
however does not invalidate any other reasons why the cartridge file might
be covered by the GNU General Public License.

Note that people who make modified versions of the Kate operating system
are not obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions;
it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception. If you modify the Kate Runtime API,
this exception does not apply to your modified version of the
Kate operating system, and you must remove this exception when
you distribute your modified version.

This exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the
GNU General Public License, version 3 (“GPLv3”), if such version is used.
