Kate v0.23.5  (May 2023)
=======================================================================

The v0.23.5 is May's experimental release of Kate with a focus on
improving the storage and input APIs as well as how we communicate
risks to players, but also includes a handful of assorted bugfixes
and small improvements in other areas.


Adding buckets to Storage API
-----------------------------

This version adds buckets to the storage API, which brings the API a
bit closer to IndexedDB in order to make it possible to bridge it
adequately.

It's a breaking change on the API level; unbucketed keys stored
previously are now moved to a "special bucket", and the code must
always acquire a reference to a bucket to operate on the key/value
pairs stored there.

Previous data is automatically migrated on boot, so it's not a
breaking change from players' perspective.


Improved input handling
-----------------------

Much of this release focused on improving Kate's input handling.
Here are some of the things landing:

  - Haptic feedback for virtual buttons: touch screens make terrible controllers,
    but when that's all you have (often the case with a phone), this version
    lets you have a bit more feedback when hitting an input button;

  - Reworked how interactive elements are communicated: the status bar will
    now be more principled in communicating what actions are available and
    how they map to console buttons, even when changing the focus changes
    the actions available;

  - Fixed many issues with focus handling: the focus now usually does what
    you expect when moving between elements in the screen. There are some
    issues with elements in different rows/columns to be worked on still.

  - Added settings screens to configure keyboard and gamepad inputs: this
    allows you to use your own button mappings rather than the default ones.
    However, there's still a restriction that one gamepad/keyboard button
    must map to one Kate button. This will change in the future.

  - All-around better support for gamepads: you can now change which gamepad
    Kate will consider as the paired one, as well as view how Kate reads your
    gamepad (in cases where it differs from the standard layout). There's
    still a limit of a single gamepad paired at any moment, but that will
    be lifted in the future.


Improved communication for dangerous actions
--------------------------------------------

Some of the actions in Kate are irreversible. This version increases the
number of channels where this is communicated by improving button colours
and using additional channels (e.g.: the "danger" label).

We're also more consistent with providing confirmation dialogs when you
try an immediately irreversible/dangerous action, so you have less worry
about accidentally deleting your data.


Recovery options
----------------

With more ways of configuring Kate comes more ways of making Kate unusable.
This version adds a "Diagnostics & Recovery" screen that can be used to
revert faulty changes.

Note that settings in Kate are not versioned, so the only supported action
is always to revert to the default settings, then reconfigure.


Pre-built binaries
------------------

This version is the first to feature pre-built native binaries (based on
Electron v24). Binaries are still unsigned and themselves unsandboxed
(though the Kate kernel and cartridges are subject to the Chromium
sandbox, as usual), but sandboxing the emulator binary is the next
step in shipping a safe Kate emulator that works for archival purposes.


Fixed bugs
----------

  - The prompt for updating a cartridge used to display the new
    cartridge details instead of the installed ones. It now
    correctly identifies what you're updating from, and what
    you're updating to.


Small improvements
------------------

  - The Single Cartridge mode now won't copy files intended for
    the Web Application mode, meaning you can just zip everything
    in the folder and upload to your web server/Itch.io.

  - Lots of small phrasing changes to make it clearer what you're
    signing up for when enabling or disabling a configuration option.
