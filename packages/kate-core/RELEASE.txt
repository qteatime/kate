Kate v0.23.5  (May 2023)
=======================================================================

The v0.23.5 is May's experimental release of Kate, including a
handful of bugfixes and small improvements.


Adding buckets to Storage API
-----------------------------

This version adds buckets to the storage API, which brings the API a
bit closer to IndexedDB in order to make it possible to bridge it
adequately.

It's a breaking change on the API level; unbucketed keys stored
previously are now moved to a "special bucket", and the code must
always acquire a reference to a bucket to operate on the key/value
pairs stored there.

Previous data is automatically migrated on boot, so it's not a
breaking change from players' perspective.


Fixed bugs
----------

  - The prompt for updating a cartridge used to display the new
    cartridge details instead of the installed ones. It now
    correctly identifies what you're updating from, and what
    you're updating to.


Small improvements
------------------

  - The Single Cartridge mode now won't copy files intended for
    the Web Application mode, meaning you can just zip everything
    in the folder and upload to your web server/Itch.io.
