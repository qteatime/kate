=======================================================================
Kate v0.24.2  (February 2024)
=======================================================================

The v0.24.2 is the Winter experimental release of Kate. This release
focuses on improving Kate's stability, making it easier for players
to play a game across multiple devices, and making it easier for
developers to publish games for Kate.


New input proxy bridge
----------------------

This release includes a new input proxy bridge that allows one to
specify a CSS selector for dispatching the events to, or keep dispatching
them on the document/window. This is necessary because every engine out
there decides to listen to events in a different place, so Ren'Py
listens to window events, Bitsy to document events, and Godot to canvas
events.


!!SECURITY!!
More stable process handling
----------------------------

The previous code for handling sandboxed processes in Kate was still in
its proof-of-concept stage. This release includes a rewrite of the process
handling to make it more stable and prepare for a future multi-process Kate.

Along with the changes, sandboxed processes are no longer using a Blob URL,
and rather pass the HTML directly into the frame. This removes one avenue
of privilege escalation where attackers could trick users to cooperate in
opening the blob URL outside of the frame, and then having their code execute
with the same privileges as Kate.

Note that this change does not yet address the issues with speculative
side-channel attacks (Spectre, etc.), as Browsers do not offer any
guarantee that a frame will be rendered in a separate process. The issue
is however mitigated in Kate as sandboxed processes do not have network
or navigation access.


Minor fixes and improvements
----------------------------

* The drop-installer indicator now shows up more reliably when dragging
  files over the console;

* Plugins are now fully disabled in sandboxed processes, which makes it harder
  for cartridges to escape their sandboxes;
