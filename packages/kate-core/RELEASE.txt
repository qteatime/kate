=======================================================================
Kate v0.23.6  (June 2023)
=======================================================================

The v0.23.6 is June's experimental release of Kate with a focus on
making it usable for common open source engines for small indie games.


More flexible resolution
------------------------

Kate uses a 800x480 resolution in hand-held mode, but that doesn't
mean games _have_ to use this resolution. Bitsy games use a square
aspect ratio, and many Ren'Py games use 16:9, or even 4:3, but they
all scale accordingly to fit within the 800x480 window.

So this release improves the support for different resolutions,
making sure things like captures and the media gallery store
and display media in the correct aspect ratio.


Case modes
----------

By default Kate runs in handheld mode, with virtual buttons meant
for touch-based devices and a 800x480 resolution. This release
adds a new TV mode and a Full-screen mode, which support a
resolution of 1200x720. The new modes are meant for running Kate
in a laptop or with an external display or TV, and taking advantage
of the additional screen space, similar to how other handhelds can
increase their resolution when docked.


Pointer input support
---------------------

This release has added an API for basic pointer support, so games
that use a mouse or a single touch point should be supported in Kate.
There's still work in the roadmap to support multi-touch games and
games that use a stylus (e.g.: where stylus pressure and tilt angle
can affect the behaviour of the game).


Functional Ren'Py support
-------------------------

With this release Kate is functionally compatible with games
exported in Ren'Py 7.5. There's some work to do in order to
make Kate also compatible with games exported in Ren'Py 8.


Storage visualisation
---------------------

There's a new settings screen for visualising and managing
different parts of the storage. This includes:

  - Archiving cartridges (deleting the cartridge files, but keeping
    save data and screenshots/video captures);
  - Deleting all save data; and
  - Deleting all cartridge-related data (except for screenshots/captures).

This should make Kate a bit more usable around managing what's
stored locally and allowing people to remove data they no longer
need to keep around.


Fixed bugs
----------

  - The local storage proxy now accounts for engines that may expect
    it to behave like a regular JavaScript object;

  - The network proxy now properly handles cases where more arbitrary
    URLs are given to be loaded, as long as we can still resolve it
    to a valid cartridge file path.

  - Paths are now normalised before Kate attempts to read them from
    the cartridge. This should result in less surprises for games
    ported through Bridges.

  - Resources are now properly cached when installing Kate as a
    web app, meaning you should be able to run the web version of
    Kate offline if you install it on an iPhone, Android, or
    Windows 10+.

  - Errors resulting from storage quota being exceeded are now
    handled more gracefully. There's some reserved system space
    to avoid being locked into unrecoverable storage states.
