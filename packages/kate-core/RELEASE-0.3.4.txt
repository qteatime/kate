=======================================================================
Kate v0.23.4  (April 2023)
=======================================================================

The v0.23.4 is April's experimental release of Kate, including a
handful of bugfixes, some new features, and a database redesign
(a breaking change).


UI redesign & code simplifications
----------------------------------

This version has a minor UI redesign including more playful
sans-serif fonts and a more pervasive use of button hints in the
status bar. There's now some audio feedback for keyboard/gamepad
actions and a more consistent handling of "X" as a "go back" button.

Custom themes are going to land sometime later this year, there's
still some work needed on how they're going to be distributed, and
how to divide up capabilities in themming (e.g.: allowing people to
install CSS files directly is too dangerous, since Kate relies
heavily on having specific visual cues for security).

There's been quite a lot of work in simplifying parts of the code,
such as focus handling and game/OS scene handling. Though the code
is still very much experimental, this should make management a
little bit easier.


Screen capture & Media gallery
------------------------------

There's support for taking screenshots and capturing videos of
gameplay from an installed cartridge. The cartridge must indicate
its intention of being captured by registering an HTML Canvas element
with the Kate Capture API.

Screenshots have audio feedback, screen recording has a visual
feedback in the form of a little recording icon in the active
resources area. Recording can be started by holding the Capture
button for a second, and stopped by holding the Capture button
for a second again.


In-game legal notices
---------------------

Games, and indie games in particular, generally include content (such
as code or assets) that have been developed by a third party, and made
available under some sort of licence. Developers need to provide
sufficiently visible notices of these licences, which is a bit trickier
when you ship a binary cartridge around.

This version of Kate adds support to including a text file that
collects all these licences into a single place, and can be displayed
to the user in a regular KateOS screen, which is similar to how other
hand-held consoles handle the issue, and should fulfill the legal
requirements of shipping licences in a readable format with your
binary distribution.


Storage and memory usage improvements
-------------------------------------

Cartridges are now unpacked in the IndexedDB storage, which means that
cartridge binary changes do not affect already installed cartridges.

Besides that, this has the benefit of improving memory usage for
installed cartridges, as the game does not need to keep all of the
files in memory while running. For games with a larger size, this
should allow a little smoother playing, as long as individual files
have reasonable sizes as well.

While reading files has an added latency because of this, files are
still loaded from local storage, so it should be fast enough for most
use cases.


A new JS packaging tool
-----------------------

This version does away with Browserify as a way of packaging Kate code
and introduces a new tool, Glomp, which handles packaging JavaScript
(and other web files) in a simplified manner.

This was a requirement for improving Kate security, as Browserify is
too large to manually audit, and it injects packages arbitrarily in the
output.

Glomp is not yet verified, and it does not handle mal-formed JavaScript;
those are the next steps before a stable release of Kate.


Loading images in HTML entry-point
----------------------------------

Images included in the HTML entry-point are now loaded while sandboxing
the HTML page, so they should work in the same way as images
dynamically loaded. Paths still need to point to a valid cartridge file
path (e.g.: `/images/loading.png`)


Active Resources Area
---------------------

It's hard to know what applications are doing sometimes. Previously
Kate distinguished between trusted/untrusted prompts (like confirmation
dialogs and menus) by showing a red border around the screen. But that
doesn't work for things like "this game is using my microphone".

This version of Kate introduces the "Active Resources Area", a small
display of icons to the right of the "= KATE =" engraving in the
emulator that shows which special resources the current application
or game is using.

Currently this is used to display the use of screen recording
(a small red bullet is displayed), or the lack of persistent storage
(a hard drive with a clock is displayed).

Lack of persistent storage here means that data stored in Kate is
stored in a "best effort" manner, where the browser might delete it
if the device is running out of space. This should only be an issue
when using Kate online, without having it installed as a WebApp.


Playing habits
--------------

This version of Kate now collects small playing habit data, meaning
that we store locally when a cartridge was last played, and how much
time in total was spent in each cartridge.

The last_played data is used to sort entries in the Home screen. The
total play times are not currently used for anything, just available
locally.
