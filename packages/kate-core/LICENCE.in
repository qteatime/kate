The Kate operating system and its components is made possible thanks to the
amazing work of other people shared under permissive licenses. The software
and assets that make up the Kate operating system are listed here.

## The Kate project licence and your rights

The Kate operating system is released under the terms of the
GNU General Public Licence version 2 or (at your option) any later version.
A copy of the GPL text is included in this file, but you can also
obtain one at https://www.gnu.org/licenses.

A special exception is made for cartridges that link to Kate exclusively
through the Kate Runtime API. Such cartridges don't modify core behaviour
of the operating system and cannot change the security and privacy guarantees
the project provides, therefore they can be released under any terms, and
there's no obligation to release the source code of such cartridges. This
exception text is also included at the end of this document.

You may get a copy of the Kate operating system's source code at
https://github.com/qteatime/kate. Information on how to build the the project
from the source code is also included there. Official releases will always
be distributed at https://github.com/qteatime/kate, and you're encouraged
to audit any modifications if you've got your copy elsewhere.

There are other components that make up  project and which
are available under different terms. Full text for all relevant licences is
included here, after attributions, in the goal of making them offline-friendly.

This software contains portions of code, fonts, images, and sounds by
third-parties, specified below.

## Kate linking exception for cartridges

                     The Kate Project Licence
                       Version 1, May 2024

The Kate operating system and other core components are provided under
the terms of the GNU General Public Licence (GPL) version 2, or
(at your choice) any later version, along with the following exceptions:

  1. Programs distributed as Kate cartridges and linked to the Kate
     operating system solely through the Kate Runtime API do not
     constitute a modified or derivative work. This linking does not
     cause the cartridge to be covered by the GPL, and does not require
     the author to provide source code for the cartridge.
     
     Note that this exception does not invalidate any other reasons why
     the cartridge might be covered by the GPL, such as linking to other
     GPL-licensed code.

  2. Data included with programs distributed as cartridges (e.g.: images,
     fonts, sound files, etc.) which do not alter the function of the
     cartridge's code, even when linked with such code, should only be
     classified as part of an aggregate work, and thus not under the
     scope of the GPL. 

Note that the people who make modified versions of the Kate operating system
are not obligated to grant these exceptions for their modified versions;
it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without these exceptions; and
these exceptions also make it possible to release a modified version which
carry these exceptions forward.

If you modify the Kate Runtime API, or modify the Kate operating system in
a way that causes a change in the Kate Runtime API, these exceptions do not
apply to your modified version of the Kate operating system, and you must
remove these exceptions when you distribute your modified version.
