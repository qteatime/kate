Copyright (c) 2023-2024, The Kate Project Authors

The Kate operating system and its components is made possible thanks to the
amazing work of other people shared under permissive licenses. The software
and assets that make up the Kate operating system are listed here.

## The Kate project licence and your rights

The Kate operating system is released under the terms of the
GNU General Public Licence version 2 or (at your option) any later version.
A copy of the GPL text is included in this file, but you can also
obtain one at https://www.gnu.org/licenses.

A special exception is made for cartridges that link to Kate exclusively
through the Kate Runtime API. Such cartridges don't modify core behaviour
of the operating system and cannot change the security and privacy guarantees
the project provides, therefore they can be released under any terms, and
there's no obligation to release the source code of such cartridges. This
exception text is also included at the end of this document.

You may get a copy of the Kate operating system's source code at
https://github.com/qteatime/kate. Information on how to build the the project
from the source code is also included there. Official releases will always
be distributed at https://github.com/qteatime/kate, and you're encouraged
to audit any modifications if you've got your copy elsewhere.

There are other components that make up  project and which
are available under different terms. Full text for all relevant licences is
included here, after attributions, in the goal of making them offline-friendly.

This software contains portions of code, fonts, images, and sounds by
third-parties, specified below.

## Kate Runtime API linking exception

Linking the Kate operating system or any of its components statically
or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on
the Kate operating system. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

Kate programs are generally distributed in the form of cartridge files that
are linked dynamically to the Kate operating system to function.
As a special exception, the copyright holders of the Kate operating system
give you permission to combine the Kate operating system with any cartridge
that communicates with the Kate operating system solely through the
Kate Runtime API. This combination does not by itself cause the resulting
cartridge to be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception
however does not invalidate any other reasons why the cartridge file might
be covered by the GNU General Public License.

Note that people who make modified versions of the Kate operating system
are not obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions;
it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception. If you modify the Kate Runtime API,
this exception does not apply to your modified version of the
Kate operating system, and you must remove this exception when
you distribute your modified version.

This exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the
GNU General Public License, version 3 (“GPLv3”), if such version is used.
