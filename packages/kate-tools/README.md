# kate-tools

This package provides two simple tools for packaging games for Kate:

- `kart` --- generates Kate cartridge (`.kart`) files from web applications with a special `kate.json` configuration;

- `kate-dist` --- generates a standalone webpage that embeds a Kate emulator for a specific Kate cartridge, which allows you to publish it as a web game in platforms like Itch.io

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en). Get it from npm:

    $ npm install @qteatime/kate-tools@experimental
