Getting started
===============

To get started with Kate you'll need a device capable of playing Kate games.
Luckily, you can turn almost any device with a modern web browser into a
Kate console by getting :doc:`the Kate emulator <install>`.

Be sure to check the :doc:`minimal system requirements <hardware>` to ensure
your device can run the :term:`emulator` (and games). And take a look at the
:doc:`display and controls <emulator>` options for the emulator to pick
the one that works best for you and your device.
