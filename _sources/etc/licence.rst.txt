Terms of use
============

Kate is made possible thanks to the amazing work of other people
shared under permissive licences. The software and assets that
make up Kate are listed here.


Kate's licence and your rights
------------------------------

Up until version 0.23.8, Kate was released under the MIT licence.
But from 0.23.10 onwards, Kate is released under the terms of the
Mozilla Public Licence, v2.0.  A copy of the MPL is included in this file,
but you can also obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

You can read the reasoning of this change in the
`GitHub patch that introduced it <https://github.com/qteatime/kate/pull/22>`_,
but the short version is that releasing it under the MPL allows better
transparency (and consequently security and auditability) for players
using modified versions of Kate.

You may get a copy of the source code at https://github.com/qteatime/kate.
Information on how to build Kate from the source code is also
included there. Official releases will always be distributed at
https://github.com/qteatime/kate, and you're encouraged to audit any
modifications if you've got your copy of Kate elsewhere.

There are other components that make up the Kate Importer project and which
are available under different terms. Full text for all relevant licences is
included here, after attributions, in the goal of making them offline-friendly.

This software contains portions of code, fonts, images, and sounds by
third-parties, specified below.
